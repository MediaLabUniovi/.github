### Hi there, it's MediaLab! 👋

MediaLab is a university laboratory of technology and design that emerged in 2018 from the collaboration between the City Council of Gijón, Gijón Impulsa, and the University of Oviedo. Its headquarters are located at the School of Engineering of Gijón, and its main objective is to bring new technologies and project creation methodologies closer to people.

The lines of work aim to add value to the projects so that they have a practical application in the market and society, as well as the creation of companies or startups and/or the publication of research. Each line of work is led by a professor from the University of Oviedo, and in turn, each line consists of more specific projects where students can carry out their Bachelor's thesis, Master's thesis, or doctoral dissertation.

- 🔭 Scholar    - We generate didactic proposals based on the projects developed in MediaLab with a curricular approach, designing interdisciplinary educational projects for different educational stages
- 📡 IOT        - We are working on develop functional prototypes based on new LPWAN IoT technologies (LoRaWAN, Sigfox, Zigbee, 6LoWPAN, NB-IoT, LTE-M, etc.
- 🩺 Healthcare - Development and dissemination of projects and prototypes that have an impact on the health of society through synergies between engineers and healthcare professional
- ♻️ Circular   - Aims to accommodate projects and initiatives mainly related to the recycling or reuse of elements discarded by marine-related companies.
- ⚡ Flexergy   - Serve as an environment for developing, sharing, and disseminating ideas and experiences aimed at improving the energy efficiency of processes and systems.
- 🦾 Robotic    - Development of an explorer robot at the scale of the Perseverance rover. 
- 💭 IF         -  IF materializes in interdisciplinary work among individuals with engineering backgrounds concerned about the ethical aspects of technology and its social impacts, and individuals studying the relationships between science, technology, and society from a philosophical perspective
- 👩‍🏫 Professors with impact - Because we have realized that the way our students think has changed, we are transforming our approach to knowledge transfer.
